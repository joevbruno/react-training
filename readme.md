#React and Redux: Getting Started

Hey there. 

Here's how to get started (no skipping ahead, no cheating: 

1. Read the [Introduction](https://github.com/joevbruno/react-training/blob/master/Intro.md) to help familiarize yourself with the basic concepts.
2. Read and re-read these [tips](https://github.com/joevbruno/react-training/blob/master/Tips.md). Not everyone will make sense now, but as you keep coming back to them, and your knowledge base grows, they will make more and more sense.
3. Refer to the [terms](https://github.com/joevbruno/react-training/blob/master/Terms.md) section. There's a fair amount of vocabulary and libraries in this world. This will help you keep them straight.
4. Keep the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/joevbruno/react-training/blob/master/Troubleshooting.md) and common problems page in the back of your head! Refer to this when you run into trouble.
5. [Setup](https://github.com/joevbruno/react-training/blob/master/Setup.md) your environment.
6. Start reading and wrestling with [tutorials](https://github.com/joevbruno/react-training/blob/master/Tutorials.md).
7. Ask for help earlier and often. If you wait until you are beyond frustrated, you're going to hate your life.
