#React and Redux: Getting Started

Hey there. 

Here's how to get started (no skipping ahead, no cheating: 

1. Read the Introduction to help familiarize yourself with the basic concepts.
2. Read and re-read these tips. Not everyone will make sense now, but as you keep coming back to them, and your knowledge base grows, they will make more and more sense.
3. Refer to the terms section. There's a fair amount of vocabulary and libraries in this world. This will help you keep them straight.
4. Keep the troubleshooting and common problems page in the back of your head! Refer to this when you run into trouble.
5. Setup your environment.
6. Start reading and wrestling with tutorials.
7. Ask for help earlier and often. If you wait until you are beyond frustrated, you're going to hate your life.
